# Replication Material for "The rippling dynamics of valenced messages in naturalistic youth chat"

This document provides detailed instructions to perform analyses analogous to those performed for the article "The rippling dynamics of valenced messages in naturalistic youth chat." The full analysis pipeline here is demonstrated using simulated data. The methodology used is a custom adaption of the causal inference techniques implemented in the _R_ package `mwa` (https://cran.r-project.org/package=mwa, authored by Sebastian Schutte and Karsten Donnay). They were adapted here to fit the requirements of the specific chat room setting in which naturalistic youth chat was analyzed.

> The specific replication material will be made available in the coming weeks. For a general overview of the functionality, please refer to the repository of the underlying `mwa` package: https://github.com/css-konstanz/mwa.
